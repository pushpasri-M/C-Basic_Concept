## 📘 Overview

This repository contains a collection of **C# basic concept programs** that I created while learning the fundamentals of **C# programming and .NET Framework**.  
It serves as a hands-on reference for understanding syntax, data types, control structures, functions, and object-oriented principles in C#.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

The main goal of this repository is to **build a strong foundation in C#** before moving on to advanced concepts like Windows Forms, ASP.NET, and backend development.  
Each program demonstrates a specific **core concept** with clean and easy-to-understand code.

---

## 📂 Topics Covered

Here are some of the key concepts demonstrated in this repository:

- ✅ Variables and Data Types  
- ✅ Input / Output Operations  
- ✅ Conditional Statements (`if`, `else if`, `switch`)  
- ✅ Loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`, `foreach`)  
- ✅ Arrays and Strings  
- ✅ Methods and Parameters  
- ✅ Classes and Objects  
- ✅ Constructors and Destructors  
- ✅ Inheritance and Polymorphism  
- ✅ Exception Handling  
- ✅ File Handling (if included)
